Formula 1 is a pencil and paper game played on a sheet of squared paper, on which a fictional car circuit is drawn, with a starting line and a finishing line (which can also coincide if the circuit is circular) . The game simulates a race taking into account the inertia of the vehicles (for example, it is necessary to brake when cornering).
